${symbol_pound}suppress inspection "UnusedProperty" for whole file

${symbol_pound} This config file is automatically loaded by each JexxaApplication if available.
${symbol_pound} I recommend that you store your production environment in this file.
${symbol_pound} Typically, you have to adjust some of these parameters when used for testing.
${symbol_pound} In this case, you can override these settings in a separate properties file. For an example please see file
${symbol_pound} jexxa-test.properties.
${symbol_pound} The advantage of this approach is that:
${symbol_pound} 1) The file should not be updated during development phase -> This prevents changes by accident
${symbol_pound} 2) The difference between development and production setup becomes visible by a separate properties file
